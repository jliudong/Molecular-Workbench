/**
 * Engines are the components that other components depend upon. For example, a molecular dynamics model is an engine,
 * because it can have other components such as a temperature slider that depends on it. The slider, however, is not an
 * engine, because no component depends on it. In other words, an engine does not have to know the existence of a
 * temperature slider when it is created, but a temperature slider must know which model it will control when it is
 * created. The authoring system should not allow a slider without a controling object.
 * 
 * Engines MUST be reused.
